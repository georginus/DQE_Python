Morning people do, however, have a reputation for getting stuff done. Early rising is associated with energy, optimisation and efficiency; it is a foundational principle of all manner of self-help and self-actualisation programmes. “if you look at many of the most productive people in the world, they’ll have one thing in common: they were early risers,” says one wide-eyed zealot in the trailer for the motivational guru hal elrod’s film about his “miracle morning”, as oprah winfrey, mahatma gandhi and albert einstein flash past. Elrod’s savers routine – silence, affirmations, visualisation, exercise, reading, scribing – is a classic of the genre, but he is only one of many urging us to seize the day super-early.

Curly has a green, irony flavour, but it’s the texture that, as mark diacono, author of herb: a cook’s companion, puts it, “people don’t want to deal with”. It’s coarser than its cooler flat-leaf cousin, so requires a little more work.

An extremely sharp knife and a courage with proportions is all you need to appreciate curly parsley. ”
